# IA-Snakes ‚Äì Snakes Clone for AI Teaching

## üìå Description

**IA-Snakes** is a Python-based clone of the classic Snake game, developed to facilitate the teaching of Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts. The project is designed to provide a hands-on environment where students can implement and test AI algorithms in a controlled setting.

## üß† Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as an educational tool for AI courses, allowing students to:

- Understand and implement basic AI algorithms.
- Experiment with AI techniques in a game-based environment.
- Analyze and improve AI performance through practical exercises.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**: Programming language used for development.
- **Pygame**: Library for creating the game interface and handling graphics.
- **AI Algorithms**: Various AI techniques implemented for game strategy.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed. Then, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
*Tip: you might want to create a virtualenv first*

## How to play

open 3 terminals:

`$ python3 server.py`

`$ python3 viewer.py`

`$ python3 Slient.py`

## Debug Installation

Make sure pygame is properly installed:

python -m pygame.examples.aliens

# Tested on:
- MacOS 15.0.1
